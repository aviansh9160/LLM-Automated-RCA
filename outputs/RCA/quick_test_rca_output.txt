Okay, here's my analysis of the provided log snippets:

**Summary of the Issue:**

The logs indicate a series of failed SSH login attempts on the server "www1".  Multiple IP addresses are attempting to log in with various usernames, including common system accounts ("administrator", "mysql", "oracle", "mailman", "nagios", "mail"), generic terms ("helpdesk", "info", "proxy"), and some seemingly random usernames ("ventrilo", "agushto", "fpass"). Many of these usernames are marked as "invalid user," suggesting they don't exist on the system. The brute force attempts from the various hosts all occur at roughly the same timestamp (June 28 2018 00:15:01).

**Likely Root Cause:**

This is very likely a **brute-force SSH attack**.  Attackers are systematically trying different usernames and passwords to gain unauthorized access to the server.  The attackers are probing for common or default usernames combined with common passwords or a dictionary attack. The "invalid user" messages suggest they are also trying usernames that don't even exist, which is typical behavior of automated brute-force attacks. The simultaneous nature of the attacks from different IPs further supports this conclusion.

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Immediate Security Measures:**

    *   **Implement a Fail2ban-like system:**  Fail2ban automatically blocks IP addresses that show malicious signs, such as too many password failures, these tools will automatically block IPs after a certain number of failed login attempts.
    *   **Change SSH Port (if possible):** While security through obscurity isn't ideal, changing the default SSH port (22) to a higher, less common port can reduce the amount of brute-force traffic.  Note: ensure your firewall rules are updated accordingly.
    *   **Disable Password Authentication:** Strongly consider disabling password authentication entirely and requiring SSH key-based authentication. This is the most effective way to prevent brute-force attacks.
    *   **Review/Enforce Strong Password Policies:** If password authentication is still necessary, enforce strong password policies (minimum length, complexity, regular changes).

2.  **Investigate the Attacking IP Addresses:**

    *   **Geolocation:** Use tools to geolocate the attacking IP addresses (65.19.167.94, 128.241.220.82, 223.205.219.198, 10.3.10.46). This might give you a clue about the origin of the attacks.
    *   **Reputation Checks:**  Check the IP addresses against reputation databases (e.g., AbuseIPDB, Spamhaus) to see if they are known sources of malicious activity.
    *   **Contact Abuse Contacts:** If the attacks are originating from legitimate organizations (e.g., universities, ISPs), consider contacting their abuse contacts to report the activity. Note - the logs are old, so this may not be a viable option.

3.  **Harden SSH Configuration:**

    *   **PermitRootLogin no:**  Disable direct root login via SSH.
    *   **AllowUsers/DenyUsers:**  Specify which users are allowed to log in via SSH.
    *   **ListenAddress:** Configure SSH to only listen on specific IP addresses (if applicable).
    *   **MaxAuthTries:** Limit the number of authentication attempts per connection.
    *   **Idle Timeout:** Configure an idle timeout to disconnect inactive SSH sessions.

4.  **Monitor Logs and System Resources:**

    *   **Regularly Review Logs:** Monitor SSH logs for any further suspicious activity.
    *   **Monitor System Resources:** Keep an eye on CPU usage, network traffic, and disk I/O to detect any potential performance impacts from the attacks.

5.  **Consider a Web Application Firewall (WAF):**

    *   If the www1 server is also running a web application, a WAF can help protect against other types of attacks (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting).

Because the logs are relatively old (2018), the attack has likely already run its course. The priority is to secure the system against future attacks. Implementing the measures described above will significantly reduce the risk.
